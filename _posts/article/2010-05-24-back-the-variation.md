## (5/23/2055 10:15:39 PM, Beside of ABC)  
Mac: Here?  
Zoe: Right.  
## (One shadow appeared in right side and disappeared in left side suddenly. And Mac was broken down.)  
Mac: Hey, what’s that?  
Zoe: Wild cat.  
Mac: Wild cat? You sure?  
Zoe: I said ‘right’.  
Mac: Right? Oh, right.  
## (While Mac within hesitate, Zoe has been gone away.)  
Mac: Hey, wait.  
## (5/23/2055 10:27:43 PM, Gate of ABC)  
Mac: Finally, we got here.  
Zoe: Right.  
Mac: Oh, don’t say right any more, please.  
Zoe: Get away. I’ll open it.  
Mac: Okay. My sister lady.  
## (One minutes late, the gate open with explosion)  
Mac: Could you be more gently?  
Zoe: Sorry. It’s my style, you know.  
Mac: Okay. But you sure we can find Eternity Sword here?  
Zoe: Who knows.  
Mac: Hey, look. A fresco.  
Zoe: It’s Chinese painting, my gentleman.  
Mac: Chinese painting? But how do you know?  
Zoe: Sorry, I’m made in China  
Mac: Humph, he has never told me.  
Zoe: He?  
Mac: He is nothing.  
## (In front of the Chinese painting)  
Mac: What does it mean?  
Zoe: A Chinese poetry. Let me try to translate.  
## Lost and found  
In a long time  
Rain is the tear of the god  
I thought  
Like a poet  

Several years’ lose  
Several years’ care  
And one day  
We met  
While the feeling became  
Clear and clear  

When nothing to talk</em>
Between the foes we are</em>
When brother we are</em>
Get coldness</em>
When the mailbox</em>
Become spider’s heaven</em>
I wake up</em>
I repent</em>
Time is just like a double-edged sword</em>
It gives me the creativeness without hesitate</em>
While it wrested my communication skill decidedly</em>
But why found must be after lost?</em>

Rain</em>
Necklaces made up by water drops</em>
I faced</em>
I just like a bird with injured wings</em>
Stay in the Phoenix Tree alone</em>
No interests to enjoy the beautiful scene</em>
One poem can’t express my helplessness</em>
Then how many can express</em>
The answer may be made me more helplessness</em>

I came back our land again and again</em>
Waiting for the meeting unexpectedly</em>
But it be the cold rain again and again</em>
And I try to ask the god</em>
Are you crying for me?</em>
Like a child</em>
<em> No answer</em>
<em> …</em>
<em> Never answer</em>

Mac: Wow, cool.
Zoe: But I hate poetry with obscurity.
<h2>(Finally the spies found them)</h2>
NPC1: We found them!
NPC2: Annihilation.
NPC1: Yes, sir.

Mac: Hand them to me, Zoe.
Zoe: And what should I do?
Mac: Eternity Sword, you must found it.
Zoe: Wait!
<h2>(And Mac has run away.)</h2>
Mac: Hey, nice guy. Let’s have a party.
<h3>[Battle: Mac Vs enemies]</h3>
<h2>(And Zoe was fret)</h2>
Zoe: Well, but be careful…
<h2>(One minutes late)</h2>
Zoe: Lost and found…That’s it, I see. Wait for me, Mac.
Mac: Ah…
Zoe: Mac!
NPC2: Humph, trash man.
Zoe: Ditch him!
NPC2: Okay. If you want.
<h2>(NPC2 killed Mac)</h2>
Zoe: No!
NPC2: Humph… Now I’ll send you him together.
Zoe: Skunk!
<h3>[Battle: Zoe Vs NPC2]</h3>
<h2>(After battle)</h2>
NPC2: Oh, forgive me, I don’t wanna be died.
Zoe: Say hello to Azrael for me.
NPC2: Ah…
Zoe: Mac…
<h2>(Zoe kneel down beside Mac)</h2>
Zoe: Why! Found must be after lost! Why! Tell me, Mac! Tell me…
<h2>(And at last, it’s raining. Fin.)</h2>
