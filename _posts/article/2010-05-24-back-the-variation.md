给大学同学写的剧本，原来打算一起用Unity3D做一个游戏，不过后来因为本人英语实在不咋地（看这剧本就知道了 :-|），遂放弃了。  

<p style="text-align: right;">Scenario by Linki Shy
Character with Zoe &amp; Mac</p>  

## (5/23/2055 10:15:39 PM, Beside of ABC)  
Mac: Here?  
Zoe: Right.  
## (One shadow appeared in right side and disappeared in left side suddenly. And Mac was broken down.)  
Mac: Hey, what’s that?  
Zoe: Wild cat.  
Mac: Wild cat? You sure?  
Zoe: I said ‘right’.  
Mac: Right? Oh, right.  
## (While Mac within hesitate, Zoe has been gone away.)  
Mac: Hey, wait.  
## (5/23/2055 10:27:43 PM, Gate of ABC)  
Mac: Finally, we got here.  
Zoe: Right.  
Mac: Oh, don’t say right any more, please.  
Zoe: Get away. I’ll open it.  
Mac: Okay. My sister lady.  
## (One minutes late, the gate open with explosion)  
Mac: Could you be more gently?  
Zoe: Sorry. It’s my style, you know.  
Mac: Okay. But you sure we can find Eternity Sword here?  
Zoe: Who knows.  
Mac: Hey, look. A fresco.  
Zoe: It’s Chinese painting, my gentleman.  
Mac: Chinese painting? But how do you know?  
Zoe: Sorry, I’m made in China  
Mac: Humph, he has never told me.  
Zoe: He?  
Mac: He is nothing.  
## (In front of the Chinese painting)  
Mac: What does it mean?  
Zoe: A Chinese poetry. Let me try to translate.  
## Lost and found  
In a long time  
Rain is the tear of the god  
I thought  
Like a poet  

Several years’ lose  
Several years’ care  
And one day  
We met  
While the feeling became  
Clear and clear  

When nothing to talk  
Between the foes we are  
When brother we are  
Get coldness  
When the mailbox  
Become spider’s heaven  
I wake up  
I repent  
Time is just like a double-edged sword  
It gives me the creativeness without hesitate  
While it wrested my communication skill decidedly  
But why found must be after lost?  

Rain  
Necklaces made up by water drops  
I faced  
I just like a bird with injured wings  
Stay in the Phoenix Tree alone  
No interests to enjoy the beautiful scene  
One poem can’t express my helplessness  
Then how many can express  
The answer may be made me more helplessness  

I came back our land again and again  
Waiting for the meeting unexpectedly  
But it be the cold rain again and again  
And I try to ask the god  
Are you crying for me?  
Like a child  
No answer  
…  
Never answer  

Mac: Wow, cool.
Zoe: But I hate poetry with obscurity.
## (Finally the spies found them)  
NPC1: We found them!
NPC2: Annihilation.
NPC1: Yes, sir.

Mac: Hand them to me, Zoe.
Zoe: And what should I do?
Mac: Eternity Sword, you must found it.
Zoe: Wait!
## (And Mac has run away.)  
Mac: Hey, nice guy. Let’s have a party.
### [Battle: Mac Vs enemies]  
## (And Zoe was fret)  
Zoe: Well, but be careful…  
## (One minutes late)  
Zoe: Lost and found…That’s it, I see. Wait for me, Mac.  
Mac: Ah…  
Zoe: Mac!  
NPC2: Humph, trash man.  
Zoe: Ditch him!  
NPC2: Okay. If you want.  
## (NPC2 killed Mac)  
Zoe: No!  
NPC2: Humph… Now I’ll send you him together.  
Zoe: Skunk!  
### [Battle: Zoe Vs NPC2]  
## (After battle)  
NPC2: Oh, forgive me, I don’t wanna be died.  
Zoe: Say hello to Azrael for me.  
NPC2: Ah…  
Zoe: Mac…  
## (Zoe kneel down beside Mac)  
Zoe: Why! Found must be after lost! Why! Tell me, Mac! Tell me…  
## (And at last, it’s raining. Fin.)
