许久没有发文了，不过这次并不是自己写的文，也不是转载的，因为没有授权。文的名字如题，End or Endless，这也是我对作者的思念。作者是“追忆过去-2”的女主角，名叫 Zanyar，但本文落款是 Flora，想来期间也改过网名吧。 
 
<blockquote>A new beginning. I wish everyone would be happy and heathy in the year 2007.

Life is just simple, as long as you like. But something seems so distant to me. I am growing up, only to find it is just a pretty nice dream in the heaven.

Course is surely more important than result, but the feeling brought by result easily hurts more.

Our encounters contain the factor of beauty, but more of them are embarrassments. You are the one. You want to spoil me, you can spoil me.

Something hasn't been wrong, but not right. Tomorrow is another day, isn't it?

I say goodbye, though I don't wanna lose you. As I don't wanna grow up, but I have to.

Lakes sparkled in the bright sunlight. Leaves were turning golden in the brilliant sunlight. It's all or nothing. Seasons in the sun, never back, ever come.

Piglet's lovely.

* 和 Zanyar 失去联络是在 2001 年左右，直到 2008 年我们重逢，中间相隔了七年。这七年或许是我有记忆以来活得最精彩的一段日子，只是 Zanyar 并不属于这段日子，实在是遗憾。  
* 2008 年至今又是六年，我与 Zanyar 又失去了联系，或者说单方面不想联系而已。不过这些都无所谓了，在一边进行 Project 7 的时候一边回忆，这种感觉很美好。期望在下一个七年到来之前能够把它完成吧。  
* Course is surely more important than result, but the feeling brought by result easily hurts more.  
* I say goodbye, though I don't wanna lose you.  
* ……能够与你相遇，拥有一份相同的回忆，真的很美好。  
* 谢谢你。  
* 再见。
